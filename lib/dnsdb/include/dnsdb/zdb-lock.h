 *  Implementation of structures and functions for the database
 *
 *  Memory usage approxymation:
 *
 *  let:
 *
 *  "digest" the size of a digest
 *  "n3pc" the number of nsec3param
 *  "r" the number of records
 *
 *  Memory usage =~ (233.3333 + ((446.666+digest) * n3pc) * r
 *
 *  Or, if the digest size is different for each n3p:
 *
 *  With "digest(n)" being the size of the digest for the n-th nsec3param
 *
 *  =~ (233.3333 + SUM[n=1..n3pc](446.666+digest(n))) * r
