/**
 * Zone locking
 * 
 * Sets the owner of a zone.
 * 
 * The owner id has a format: the msb is reserved to say that the access is
 * exclusive to only one instance of the owner.
 * The remaining bits are the id.
 * 
 * Mostly used for the simple reader and various writers.
 * 
 * A new feature needs to be added: being able to pre-lock for an owner.
 * 
 * Explanation: I want to lock for the signing process.  But that process
 * is done in two or three phases.  The first phase is read-only (thus allowing
 * the server to work normally).  But I don't want somebody else, say, a dynamic
 * update, to lock the zone in the mean time. (Which would happen when the lock
 * is transferred from the reader to the signer (at the commit phase).
 * So I'll add a secondary owner, meant to tell "I lock as a reader BUT I also
 * reserve the right for myself later".  And later a transfer can be done to
 * the secondary as soon as the last reader unlocks.
 * 
 * zdb_zone_double_lock(zone, owner, secondary owner)
 * zdb_zone_try_double_lock(zone, owner, secondary owner)
 * zdb_zone_transfer_lock(zone, secondary owner)
 * 
 * The parameter would need to be repeated to detect inconsistencies (bugs)
 * 
 * This should have no effect on the normal locking mechanism, thus ensuring
 * no loss of speed.  The only goal is to avoid a race changing the owner.
 * 
 * Having only zdb_zone_transfer_lock(zone, old owner, new owner) cannot work
 * because nothing prevents two soon-to-be writers to lock and work in tandem.
