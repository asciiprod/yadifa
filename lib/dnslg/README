20160719:
    YADIFA 2.2.1

        Multi-master support:
            Added axfr-retry-failure-delay-multiplier and axfr-retry-failure-delay-max <main> parameters to increase the time between two AXFR/IXFR retries on a master.

        Fixes:
        - fixed an issue that would crash a YADIFA slave when restarting with a journal present
        - fixed an issue in AXFR/IXFR retry timing management

20160715:
	YADIFA 2.2.0
        
        Multi-master support:

            In <zone>, the masters field is now a list.
            When the master fails to answer, it is moved to the end of the list and (new) first one is used instead.

            There is a true-multimaster setting, defaulted to 'no'.  In true multimaster mode, changing the master implies dropping local zone data and ignore serial values.
            This is to be used for a setup with truly independent masters.

            By default, the master change occurs at first failure. This can be changed to a higher value with multimaster-retries (maximum: 255)
            This mostly makes sense on true-multimaster mode as you want to be sure before reloading a zone completely.

        Smart signing:

            Keys with smart signing information are now handled by YADIFA.

        DNSSEC policies:

            YADIFA generates an rolls your keys and makes a non-DNSSEC zone into an NSEC or NSEC3 one.


        Support for ECDSA algorithm.

        Better support for huge incremental changes of a zone:
            YADIFA used to do the modification in one go, which could make it unresponsive for very big changes.
            Now the changes are applied more slowly, allowing queries to be answered.

        New network model:
            A new network model can be enabled. This model's main purpose is to be more resistent to system stalls with minimal, if any, performance loss.

            <main> network-model 1

        NSEC3 management improved.
            Several improvements have been made on the way NSEC3 is handlded.  Chains partially covering the zone are now accepted.

        Fixes:
        - fixed an issue where the maximum pid value supported was 99999
        - fixed an issue with RRSIG TTL values that were not always at the expected value.
        - fixed an issue with the $TTL not being respected.

20160126:
        YADIFA 2.1.6

        Fixes:
        - fixed an issue where the referral would not be measured for UDP on a optimised build.

20160108:
        YADIFA 2.1.5

        Dynamic updates do not use temporary files anymore which improves their general performance.
        The statistics now shows the referrals.

        Fixes:
        - fixed an issue where getting a huge incremental transfer would prevent the server from answering queries while applying the changes.
        - fixed an issue serving IXFR that would occur when a incremental change step was bigger than 64KB
        - fixed an issue for Solaris with the memory alignment fix not active everywhere
        - fixed an issue on the Solaris build settings
        - fixed an issue where sometimes yadifad would not find a configuration file given as a parameter with a relative path
        - fixed an issue where a wild-card would not be properly returned with an AXFR
        - fixed an issue where dynamically updating a zone at a speed such that the zone file would need to be written multiple times on disk
          before finishing the previous write could lead to a deadlock

20151026:
        YADIFA 2.1.4

        The zone reader error reporting has been improved.
        Stacktrace support added for Solaris.

        Known issue:
        - Adding and or removing NSEC3PARAM dynamically is not properly handled.

        Fixes:
        - fixed an issue where an NSEC3 answer proving a * query would lead to a crash
        - fixed an issue where a private key may be not recognised as such
        - fixed an issue where dynamic update prerequisite check would fail a valid match
        - fixed an issue where zone signature maintenance would only start if all private keys were available.

20150821:
        YADIFA 2.1.3

        Fixes:
        - fixed an issue that could lead to a crash at startup
        - fixed an issue where parsing a TYPE#### record would stop the parser prematurely


20150814:
        YADIFA 2.1.2

        The ./configure script has a new option: --enable-full-ascii7
        This changes the behaviour of DNS name validation to accept all the ASCII7 characters instead of only the DNS-space ones.
        Enabling this option is not recommended.

        Fixes:
        - fixes an issue where the hmac-shaX identification string sent with a TSIG had the suffix ".sig-alg.reg.int".

20150714:
        YADIFA 2.1.1

        The yadifa command line has a new option: --config|-c file : read the specific configuration file instead of ~/.yadifa.rc

        Issues detected on the NSEC3 database have now been upgraded from debug to info/warning

        Fixes:
        - fixed an issue where, on some cases; the garbage collector for the zones was not triggering for a long time.
        - fixed an issue in the Makefile (courtesy of DENIC)
        - fixed an issue where a few bytes could be leaked in some rare cases when failing to unload a zone
        - fixed an issue in RRL where some values of IPv6 prefix
        - fixed an issue accepting some answers on IXFR transfers

20150424:
        YADIFA 2.1.0

        New journal file format:
      
            This new format addresses a few issues like having maximum journal file and
            a relatively constant random access time even for very big sizes.

        The internal messaging queue has been changed to address huge amount of zones.

        New CHaos queries supported:
            hostname
            id.server

        Known issues:
        _ building successfully with LTO may require to append both AR=gcc-ar and RANLIB=gcc-ranlib to the ./configure command


20150403:
        YADIFA 2.0.6

        This release is a public release.

20141216:
        YADIFA 2.0.4

        This release is a public release.

        By popular demand, the default log file directory is now PREFIX/var/log/yadifa.  It can be set using --with-logdir=/my/dir

        Improved build mechanism.
            It has been tested to work automatically on Linux, FreeBSD, OSX, SunOS.
            RedHat family builds will use -O2 as maximum optimisations.

            Note that some optional features are now enabled by default but can be disabled.

        Fixes:
        - fixed an issue with the AXFR transfer where the serial number would not be properly taken into account
        - fixed an issue with the notify mechanism that could occur if the server was only listening to 127.0.0.1 
        - fixed an issue with bogus DNSKEY records that may potentially lead to a crash in openssl
        - fixed a reported potential "tmpfile" vulnerability on DEBUG builds (generated with make debug)
        - fixed an issue with IPv6 connections on some architectures
        - typos fixes
        - minor fixes and improvements

    Known issue:
    - removing the last key of a signed zone is permitted by YADIFA but triggers some chicken-egg issue with signatures.

    yadifa remote client commands prototype is now available with the following supported commands:

        -shutdown
            shuts down yadifa
            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t shutdown
            
        -cfgreload
            reloads the <key> and <zone> sections of the yadifad configuration

            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t cfgreload

        -logreopen
            closes and reopen the log files

            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t logreopen

        -freezeall
            prevents all zones from being updated dynamically with nsupdate
            
            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t freezeall

        -freeze
            prevents a zone from being updated dynamically with nsupdate

            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t freeze -q somedomain.eu

        -unfreezeall
            enables updates of all zones again

            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t unfreezeall

        -unfreeze
            enables updates of a zone again

            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t unfreeze -q somedomain.eu

        In order to work, the allow-control ACL must be defined either in <main> for the global commands and
        may also be defined in <zone> for the ones targeting a specific zone.

            e.g. allow-control 127.0.0.1

        Note that tsig is not supported in the client yet.

		_ fixed journal replay issue where some RRSIGs records were not properly removed
		_ fixed an issue occurring with IPv6 queries
		_ fixed an issue in the generation of a specific NSEC3 error answer
		_ fixed named query style layout

	Known issue:
		_ if the serial of a zone is changed in a way that it goes beyond a value such as
		  the journal serial start is bigger than the journal serial end, issues are expected
		  for IXFR answers.
		_ notify is ignored on TCP

	YADIFA 1.0.0RC2
		_ fixed logging issue on work file creation error
		_ fixed an issue where IXFR queries could be rejected as being wrongly formatted
		_ fixed an issue in the query logging text
		_ enabled command line options ( -u uid -g gid -d )

	YADIFA 1.0.0RC1

	Is a full functional authoritative name server:

		- works as primary or secondary name server
		- AXFR
		- IXFR
		- NOTIFY
		- NSUPDATE
		- TSIG
		- CLASSES:
			- IN
			- CH (just for version)
		- TYPES:
			- AAAA
			- CNAME
			- DNSKEY
			- DS
			- HINFO
			- MX
			- NAPTR
			- NS
			- NSEC3
			- NSEC3PARAM
			- NSEC
			- PTR
			- RRSIG
			- SOA
			- SRV
			- SSHFP
			- TXT
		- Automatic resigning
		- DNSSEC algorithms:
			- 5 (RSASHA1)
			- 7 (RSASHA1-NSEC3
		- ACL's
	

	KNOWN ISSUES:

		NSEC3:	_ cannot work with multiple NSEC3PARAM chains with mixed OPT-IN/OUT settings

			_ adding a new NSEC3 chain expects that the master sends the NSEC3PARAM first (it does not seems to be always the case)
				  We have a case where a master starts with 2 thousands NSEC3 opt-out records then adds 6 millions NSEC3 opt-in records but does not give the NSEC3PARAM record
				  first. The slave server rejects them all because it's unable to link them to a chain.  (This one has high priority)

		DNSSEC:	_ it is not allowed to change the zone security mode (unsecure, NSEC, or NSEC3).  Once the zone is loaded it keeps its security mode.

			_ dynamic updates of NSEC as well as NSEC3 records are refused

		QUIT:	the server will shutdown on the following conditions:

			_ detection of an impossible situation or an internal integrity issue (ie: for any reason the SOA has vanished from a zone)

			_ memory limit reached which prevents any more work

			_ ipc issue which prevent internal services communication

		ACL:	_ since the access control is set by zone and CHAOS class is not implemented as a configurable zone, it is not possible (yet) to specifically block CHAOS queries.

		-	many fixes 

	KNOWN ISSUE: NSEC3 slave zone replay fails.

20110706:
	YADIFA 0.5.0
		-	slave mode, AXFR/IXFR (no TSIG yet for the slave-side transfer)
		-	answers to a notify from the master
		-	polls the (first) master on the masters list
		-	maintains the .axfr & .ix files (deletes the obsoletes ones)
		-	TSIG queries are checked
		-	Replays the zone journal on startup after the zone load (journaling)
		-	Answers IXFR queries (journaling)

20110601:
	YADIFA 0.4.0
		Operational:
		-	It works as a no dnssec name server
		-	No notifies to slave name servers
		-	daemon
		-	Answers AXFR queries with TSIG
		- 	nsupdate functionality (journaling)
		-	TSIG on client server side will be transmitted, but not checked
		-	ACL works
		- 	The zone has SOA, NS A resource records.

20110524:
	YADIFA 0.3.0
		First release internally of yadifad 20110524115500 GMT+1.

		Operational:
		-	It works as a no dnssec name server
		-	No notifies to slave name servers
		-	daemon
		-	Answers AXFR queries
		- 	The zone has SOA, NS A resource records.
		

20091224:
	YADIFA 0.2.0
		_	Answers AXFR queries
		_	ACL based on IP and TSIG (not all query types are ACL'ed yet)

20091104:
	YADIFA 0.1.0

		YADIFA is a work in progress. The main goal is to have an alternative for BIND or NSD.

		Version 0.1.0 is an authoritative server only. 

		It has no:
		-	AXFR/IXFR functionality
		-	dynupdate
		- 	support for NSEC
		- 	support for NSEC3
		-	caching mechanism
		- 	additional tools (eg.dig, dnssectools, drill,...)

		It has:
		-	a very fast way to give authoritative answer
		-	a very fast method for loading the database and checking the zone files

		This first release is to have a feeling how it works in an operational environment.
	
	TODO

		Everything what is not implemented, has to be implemented. Most of the code is there, but is not activated.

		No comformity tests has been done. (This of course is on the todo list)
