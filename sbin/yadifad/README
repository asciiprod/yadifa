20171208:
    YADIFA 2.3.0-2.3.7
        From now on, both master and slaves are updating the zone in the same manner (journal transactions)
        Messages are now default (--enable-messages). Disable them using --disable-messages.
        Adds more (dynamic) update validation.
        Adds a build option to remove compile date and time from various help messages (--disable-build-timestamp)
        A master can now be configured to allow updating RRSIG records externally (e.g.: update add domain. RRSIG ...)
        Added thread_pool_try_enqueue_call to give up if a queue is full or overworked.

        Fixes an issue where closing an (a)XFR stream could lead to a race over the file descriptors.
        Fixes an issue where an AXFR query would return a version of the zone too old to be upgradable by following incremental updates.
        Fixes an issue where zones with big-enough NSEC3 coverage (several millions NSEC3 record) could potentially reach an internal limit of the database.
        Fixes an issue where shutting down YADIFA while a zone is being downloaded (AXFR) may make it wait forever.
        Fixes an issue where the slave would complain about a missing private key.
        Fixes an issue where a specifically truncated IXFR query may make YADIFA replying with an AXFR.
        Fixes an issue where an IXFR query returning "not implemented" instead of an AXFR would be retried later as an IXFR.
        Fixes an issue where hammering reopening the logs on an overloaded server would not work properly.
        Fixes an issue with the CW queuing mechanism when trying to fill a full queue.
        Fixes an issue on servers using the network-model 1 model (<main> : network-model 1)
        Fixes an issue where the removal in a certain order of hash/hash* related domains would end-up triggering an abort
        Fixes an issue where querying a signed domain that was deleted would answer NOERROR instead of NXDOMAIN
        Fixes an issue where a zone loaded with a journal would not be marked "dirty" and thus would not be fully dumped on disk upon kill -USR1
        Fixes an issue with network aliases not configured on all setups of --enable-messages
        Fixes an issue with the logger not releasing the log files before reconfiguration
        Fixes an issue with the journal where heavy load would prevent notification to slaves

        Note: SunOS 5.10 requires setting --disable-messages in ./configure

        Note: Altough Debian/Hurd is not officially supported, YADIFA builds and works on the 2017 iso by setting --disable-messages in ./configure 

            ECDSA can now be disabled at ./configure time.
            The support of ECDSA is not available in the openssl package of older Linux distributions.
            You can now add --disable-ecdsa at configure time to allow a build on these systems.

        Processed signals are now logged upon processing (info level) to allow the admin to know when a signal has effectively gone through.

        CPU affinity can now be tuned to stick a worker on a core.  In <main>:

            thread-affinity-multiplier can be used to use every (1) or every odd (2) logical CPU.

                Parameter range from 0 to 4.  (default is 0 = autodetect)
                By default, if hypertheading is detected, the multiplier is set to 2, else to 1.
            
            thread-affinity-base can be used to chose the first local CPU to consider.

                Parameter range from 0 to 3. (default is 0)

            In the end, network workers will have their affinity set to (base + multiplier * workerindex).

            The main purpose is to avoid using the hyperthread logical CPU as it can be counterproductive in some setups for high (10Gbps) troughput.
